## How to test our project?

To run our project, all you need to do is execute ```python Projeto_IA_1.py ``` in the src folder.

After this, the following menu will appear:

|        What method do you want         |
|     to use to find the total score?    |

|                                        |
|       1- Tabu Search                   |
|       2- Simulated Annealing           |
|       3- Hill Climbing                 |
|       4- Genetic Algorithm             |
|       5- Other                         |

|                                        |
|             [B] - Go back              |
|               [E] - Exit               |
|                                        |
------------------------------------------
Option: 

```
By choosing an option, the corresponding algorithm will start operation. Depending on the chosen algorithm, the user might be prompted to input additional values (For example, for the tabu search or the genetic algorithm, etc.).

Upon completion of the algorithm, the program will display the maximum score obtained, and it will also generate a file containing the requested information outlined in the project description.
